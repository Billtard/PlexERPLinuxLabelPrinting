Using Puppeteer to collect the ZPL print command from Plex.

You need to have Node.js installed. 

Install Puppeteer

## Install Puppeteer: First, ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, you can install Puppeteer by running:

```bash
npm install puppeteer
```

Running the puppeteer script.

```bash
node findPrinterCode_label_file.js
```
This will open a new Chrome Window
For ZPL printing there is a Python Script "PrintZPL.py".

- Notes
    Ensure that your printer is compatible with ZPL.
    Check the printerâ€™s documentation for any specific instructions or configurations needed for printing.
    You may need to configure your printer settings to accept ZPL commands.
    By following these steps, you should be able to print your ZPL file successfully! If you have any specific issues or errors while printing, feel free to ask for help!
